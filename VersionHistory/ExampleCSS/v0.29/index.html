                <h2>Can't < br > quite yet</h2>
                <p>So using a br on the body (outside of the card elements) breaks the code (trying to figure out still). Vaguely remember shrinking the body by 75%, so I guess I'll start there. <b>Workaround</b> is to use BR on the titles for now. Funny how most of my issues are stemming from not properly researching the page setup. Shows that I've been far too reliant on Wordpress in the past. <br><br></p>
                <h2>Forgot something</h2>

                <textarea type="text" value="test" class="code-input">Good job finding this little prompt. Thank you, too. I appreciate the engagement.<br> Well, these cards have been an interesting first 'project' for sure. Whilst the majority of the code is my own input, I realise (half way through - I'm still not particularly happy with the results) I was far too reliant on CoPilot. I would still absolutely recommend it as a learning tool, and development tool. The amount of shit I've learned in a few days is.. Unreal. It opens a huge door for knowledge, and is engaging enough to feel like an actual teacher. Granted, a teach who is constantly incorrect, and breaks your code on a regular basis. But shit, it's all about that code vocab.<br> My second 'project', flexbox, uses only my own input. In the future, I'll be adding snippets of code for 'ease of access'. It'll be in relation to whatever comes of this page. Still need to make it nice and pretty. I guess this card turned out to be an unintended mini dev log.</textarea>

    <h2>Grid Container CSS</h2>
    <p>The barebones of how the grid works. Opposite to flexbox, grid container retains the grid format in a more 'static' way. I'm a pretty big fan of the customizability it offers. It seems that every .card I have placed within is fully responsive - to an extent. Scaling the screen size seems to increase the entire row size dependant of content within the P. I guess this is the downside of not using flexbox. Probably best to use this when there is a character limit, or with only 4-6 cards per grid. The pretty awesome thing I discovered is if you add a hover to the card (click activate), the grid automatically resizes to the content. Pretty sweet. I guess a workaround in the meanwhile is to center/align/justify (still trying to remember which one) h2 & P to the center of the card.</p>

Here's what ChatGPT reviews your tenure: Over the last 12 years, the Conservative Party has taken us on quite the rollercoaster ride! They've promised fiscal discipline but somehow managed to balloon the national debt while handing out more tax cuts than a fire sale. From Brexit chaos to party scandals, it's been a sitcom of leadership changes and policy U-turns. Their environmental policy? As green as a coal mine! Through it all, they've insisted they're the party of stability—if by stability, you mean consistently unpredictable. It's like they’ve been binge-watching "House of Cards" and taking notes on how not to run a country!</textarea>

Our trials, reminiscent of the “Love Boat” episode’s humorous mishaps, confirm its purifying power.
